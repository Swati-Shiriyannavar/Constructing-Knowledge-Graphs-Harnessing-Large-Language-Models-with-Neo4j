Databricks, Inc. is a global data, analytics and artificial intelligence company founded by the original creators of Apache Spark.[3]

The company provides a cloud-based platform to help enterprises build, scale, and govern data and AI, including generative AI and other machine learning models.[4]

Databricks pioneered the data lakehouse, a data and AI platform that combines the capabilities of a data warehouse with a data lake, allowing organizations to manage and use both structured and unstructured data for traditional business analytics and AI workloads.[5]

Databricks acquired MosaicML for $1.4 billion in June 2023, its largest acquisition.[6]

In November 2023, Databricks unveiled the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform, a new offering that combines the unification benefits of the lakehouse with MosaicMLâ€™s Generative AI technology to enable customers to better understand and use their own proprietary data.[7]

The company develops Delta Lake, an open-source project to bring reliability to data lakes for machine learning and other data science use cases.
